                <h2>Early Life</h2>
                <p>
                    Mahatma Gandhi, born Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, hailed from a modest background. His father, Karamchand Gandhi, served as the chief minister of Porbandar, while his mother, Putlibai, was deeply religious and influenced young Gandhi's spiritual development.

Gandhi's early education took place in India, and at the age of 19, he traveled to London to study law at University College London. His time in England exposed him to various cultures and ideologies, shaping his future philosophies. After completing his studies, Gandhi struggled to establish a legal practice in India, leading him to accept a position in South Africa in 1893. It was in South Africa that he experienced racial discrimination firsthand, which ignited his lifelong fight against injustice and colonialism.

These formative years laid the groundwork for Gandhi's later activism and his commitment to non-violent resistance, setting the stage for his pivotal role in India's struggle for independence.

					Mahatma Gandhi remained a steadfast advocate for India's independence, championing the principles of non-violence and civil disobedience. During World War I, he initially supported the British war effort with the expectation of political concessions for India. However, disillusioned by the lack of significant reforms post-war, he intensified his efforts towards achieving self-rule for India.

In World War II, Gandhi's stance against British rule became even more pronounced. He launched the Quit India Movement in 1942, calling for the immediate withdrawal of British colonial forces from India. Despite facing imprisonment, Gandhi's message resonated deeply with the Indian populace, galvanizing widespread support for the independence struggle.
Throughout both conflicts, Gandhi's unwavering commitment to non-violence and his insistence on peaceful resistance stood as a beacon of hope and moral authority. His actions not only propelled India towards independence but also left an indelible mark on the global stage, inspiring countless movements for civil rights and social justice around the world.

					Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated at 5:17 p.m. on January 30, 1948, while he was walking to address a prayer meeting in the garden of Birla House (now Gandhi Smriti) in New Delhi. Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, fired three bullets into Gandhi's chest from close range. Some accounts suggest Gandhi died instantly, while others indicate he was carried into a bedroom where he passed away about 30 minutes later as verses from Hindu scriptures were read. The assassination plunged India into mourning, with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru addressing the nation over the All-India Radio, expressing the profound loss felt by millions across the country. Godse, along with several other conspirators, was arrested soon after the assassination. The trial concluded with Godse and Narayan Apte being sentenced to death, while others received varying sentences, including life imprisonment.
